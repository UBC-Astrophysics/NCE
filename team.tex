The partnership consists of representatives from UVic, UBC, SFU,
Compute Canada, tOcean Networks Canada, he Space Telescope Science
Institute, International Virtual Observatory Association, and industry
partners from Urthecast and Magnetar Games.  UrtheCast will provide
multispectral remote sensing data and have strong expertise in GIS.
Magnetar games provide expertise on immersive user interfaces and
augmented reality.  We envision developing web-based prototypes
allowing a non-expert citizen scientist to not only access the data
but to interact with the data as an expert would, creating new
simulations and perhaps more importantly to combine data from
different domains to generate new understanding.
