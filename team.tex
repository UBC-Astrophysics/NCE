The partnership consists of representatives from UVic, UBC, SFU,
Compute Canada, tOcean Networks Canada, he Space Telescope Science
Institute, International Virtual Observatory Association, and industry
partners from Urthecast and Magnetar Games.  UrtheCast will provide
multispectral remote sensing data and have strong expertise in GIS.
Magnetar games provide expertise on immersive user interfaces and
augmented reality.  We envision developing web-based prototypes
allowing a non-expert citizen scientist to not only access the data
but to interact with the data as an expert would, creating new
simulations and perhaps more importantly to combine data from
different domains to generate new understanding.

\subsection*{Yvonne Coady} 
Yvonne leads the systems research group at the University of Victoria, exploring cloud-based application infrastructure and scientific visualization.  Her group has had impact in optimizations and efficiencies afforded by new hardware and infrastructure in a wide range of scientific applications, including the Thirty Meter Telescope and Near Field Tsunami Detection and Warning Systems.  As a co-recipiant of the University of Victoria's Knowledge Mobilization Award, and a co-winner of Johnson & Johnson's Cognition Challenge, she has been both locally and internationally recognized for her participation in Knowledge Translation activites.

\subsection*{Tania Lado Insua}
Tania has investigated environmental impacts of oil-spills on mussel communities using population genetics techniques, and holds a Diploma of Advanced Studies in Marine Biology and Aquaculture from the University of Vigo, in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez.  She obtained MS and PhD degrees in Ocean Engineering from the University of Rhode Island with research focusing on applying models of sediment physical properties to past and present climate change. Her most recent research includes international collaborations on diverse research topics such as environmental impact evaluation for renewable energies, paleoceanography, physical properties of the sediment, geohazards monitoring, seafloor observatories and paleoclimate. 


\subsection*{Brian Thom}
Brian’s research focus is on the political, social and cultural processes that surround Indigenous people's efforts to resolve Aboriginal title and rights claims and establish self-government.  His written work explores the interplay of culture, power and colonial discourses in land claims negotiations, and examines the political and ontological challenges for Indigenous people engaged with institutions of the state.  He is principle investigator for the research project Innovations in Ethnographic Mapping and Indigenous Cartographies, currently funded by SSHRC and Google. This project grapples with the practical problem of implementing socially and politically powerful mapping initiatives which can effectively visualize and communicate indigenous peoples’ knowledge and experience of the land. Through cutting-edge immersive, networked, multimedia cartographic systems, this project offers a response to the critique that the dots and lines of conventional ethnographic mapping reduces and essentializes indigenous territoriality and senses of place.
