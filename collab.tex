By offering an open and collaborative platform, CHORUS will strengthen, expand and intensify meaningful international collaborations across a variety of knowledge domains, including astrophysics, oceanography, remote sensing, fisheries, emergency
management and robotics.  The need for a common infrastructure, in particular for applications that crosscut both the knowledge domains and datasets involved, will build links and ensure shared benefits between national and internation institutions alike.   We have successfully assembled leading practioners from both academic and industry stakeholders involved in extracting information from existing Earth Observation platforms.
