By offering an open and collaborative platform, CHORUS will
strengthen, expand and intensify meaningful international
collaborations across a variety of knowledge domains, including
astrophysics, oceanography, remote sensing, fisheries, natural
resources development, energy, agriculture, emergency management,
public health, social services and robotics.  The need for a common
infrastructure, in particular for applications that crosscut both the
knowledge domains and datasets involved, will build links and ensure
shared benefits between national and international institutions alike.
We have successfully assembled leading practioners from both academic
and industry stakeholders involved in extracting information from
existing Earth Observation platforms as well as databases from
observational on the ground.

By distributing the computation to end user can provide a prospective
model to a mutually trusted server that has access to the private
database.  The server would return a single number or a few numbers to
quantify the quality of the model.
