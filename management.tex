Yvonne Coady will be the executive in charge of the entire network.
The bulk of the software will be developed at UVic, under her
supervision. She will be in charge of hiring and managing the team to
develop the knowledge-transformation platform. She will also design
the general architecture of CHORUS.

Jeremy Heyl will engage the core group of stakeholders and grow the
network.  He will gather the contributions from the individual
stakeholders, identifying which databases to include and how to
include them.  He will also design the initial set of analysis tools
available within the platform and will develop the interface in
collaboration with partners at STSci and Magnetar Games.
