Yvonne Coady will be the executive in charge of the entire network:
the setting and meeting of short-term goals and the general financial
planning.  The bulk of the software will be developed at UVic, under
her supervision. She will be in charge of hiring and managing the team
to develop the knowledge-transformation platform. She will also design
the general architecture of CHORUS.

Jeremy Heyl will engage the core group of stakeholders and grow the
network.  Jeremy will be in charge of the organization of the formal
collaboration meetings as well as the one-on-one meetings with the
various stakeholders to discuss their detailed needs and incorporate
them into the software development. He will gather the contributions
from the individual stakeholders, identifying which databases to
include and how to include them.  He will also design the initial set
of analysis tools available within the platform and will develop the
interface in collaboration with partners at STSci and Magnetar Games.
